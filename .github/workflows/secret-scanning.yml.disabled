# Original file: .github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml
# Disabled on: 2026-02-28
# Reason: Gitleaks reporting configuration errors after .gitleaks.toml updates
#
# To re-enable:
# 1. Fix the SARIF output configuration in gitleaks-action
# 2. Rename this file back to secret-scanning.yml
# 3. Test the workflow manually
