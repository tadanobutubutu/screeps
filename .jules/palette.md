## 2025-05-22 - [Refining Button Feedback During Async Operations]
**Learning:** Adding visual feedback (like icons and animations) to an interactive element during an async operation is only half the battle. To ensure full accessibility, the parent element's `aria-label` and `title` must also be updated to reflect the transient state, as screen readers often prioritize the parent's label over its children.
**Action:** Always verify that state-driven UI changes are reflected in parent container ARIA attributes and title tags, especially for buttons and other interactive elements.
