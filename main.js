/* deploy.js – Deployment helper utilities
 *
 * The original file contained typographic quotation marks (smart
 * quotes) that caused a linting / parsing error. Those have been
 * straightened out and the module is now syntactically valid.
 *
 * The module now exports the helper functions for test consumption and
 * general use.
 *
 * Additionally, the following new functions have been added to address
 * the Dependency Dashboard issues:
 * - `getPostHogVersion`
 * - `getSupabaseVersion
